# tagVerifier
Sometimes we have to many css files and some cloud based servers (like Oracle Commerce Cloud) stop working without saying which file is wrong. This php file checks all files (for now just .less) in Oracle Commerce Cloud structure. 

The only thing that's needed is to put it where dcu files are downloaded. 

Future improvements are:
<ul>
<li>Generalize to work with any sort of file structure</li>
<li>Check html tags using</li>
</ul>
